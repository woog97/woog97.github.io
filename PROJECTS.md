 - hex. 
  a strategy game similar to go, harder than chess, learnable in 30 seconds.
  impossible to tie, theoretical first player forced win, optimal solution not known.
take turns occupying cells of a hexagonal grid. connect your color’s sides to win.
play here against a friend, or against the AI. comes with a simple game analyzer gui.

 - this website. turns out, building a personal website is pretty easy. i followed this tutorial to get started.
after the basic setup, i determined the purposes i wanted this website to fulfill: an extension to my socials profiles, space for personal expression, and place to showcase the projects on my resume.

 - hybrid classifier: determined to transition into a career in data science, i scoured my brain for project ideas. following some medium article’s advice, i searched for anything i could formulate as remotely business oriented, while still being connected to something i care about to stay motivated.
i made a mathematical content classifier. taking in one or several consecutive discord messages  and any attachments it has as input, it outputs which channel it probably belongs to on the global math server. designed to be lightweight and flexible while still as accurate as possible, it’s tweaked and benchmarked with a few target purposes in mind.

 - stallings foldings, the app. a friend of mine spent a good amount of time in undergrad and his masters studying geometric group theory. in particular, he studied representations of subgroups of free groups. one way to do this is via stallings graphs and stallings foldings. the algorithm is often done on a chalkboard or whiteboard. im building an interactive app that lets you do all that good stuff a bit more easily.
