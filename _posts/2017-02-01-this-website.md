turns out, building a personal website is pretty easy. i followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZsgPgGdOzQ) tutorial to get started.
after the basic setup, i determined the purposes i wanted this website to fulfill: an extension to my socials profiles, space for personal expression, and place to showcase the projects on my resume. well actually i determined those purposes beforehand, but now it was time to implement them conscientiously. there is intentionally no personally identifying information on this page.

maybe i will include more points later, as i build this website
