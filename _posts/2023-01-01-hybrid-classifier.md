determined to transition into a career in data science, i scoured my brain for project ideas. following some medium article’s advice, i searched for anything i could formulate as remotely business oriented, while still being connected to something i care about to stay motivated.
i made a mathematical content classifier. taking in one or several consecutive discord messages  and any attachments it has as input, it outputs which channel it probably belongs to on the global math server. designed to be lightweight and flexible while still as accurate as possible, it’s tweaked and benchmarked with a few target purposes in mind. well, that's what i'm trying to make it do, anyway. we'll see how that goes.
