# i am woog.

### i studied math in undergrad, and learned programming afterwards. i now spend my time exploring various hobbies and ambitiously reverse engineering neural networks.
some of my projects and interests are listed below. when not working on technical things, i [meditate](https://woog97.github.io/dharma/).

## mechanistic interpretability
