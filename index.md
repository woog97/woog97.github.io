# i am woog.

### i studied math in undergrad, and learned programming afterwards. i now spend my time exploring various hobbies and ambitiously reverse engineering neural networks.
some of my projects and interests are listed below. when not working on technical things, i [meditate](https://woog97.github.io/dharma/).

as of jan 15th, i've been running an ai safety camp project, "towards ambitious mechanistic interpretability."  
the scope of our work is just doing things generally of value for the community with no particular conceptual focus or theme.  
i mostly just supervise and coordinate good people to do good things and channel their minds effectively.  
thus most work cannot be directly attributed to me, i can only list things i helped make happen.

- distillation of the whole mech interp field, for a general non-technical audience and for policy makers (to be self-published on above site)
- further attention superposition, a [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aojvhGBF5GiAd0niWSmRhExKy4cq3CPynDMkmUWkL-w/edit#slide=id.g1efcac9d369_1_191)

- [bilinear interp](https://github.com/tdooms/bilinear-interp/tree/main)

project graveyard/limbo
- efficient implementation of [semiring backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03056) for computing path entropy
- sharing my thoughts more openly outside of random discord channels, maybe in a blog
- persistent cohomology on sae features (failed, should still write up negative findings)
